# 2015 Bristol Bay "Family" Size

In the Bristol Bay, Alaska sockeye gillnet fishery, permits are attached to an individual person instead of a vessel. While you can apply to have a second permit, it's also possible for someone you know, including a family member, to hold a permit for you. Looking at the most recent 2015 data, how many permits are attached to a given last name? I used last name because it's the only way I could attempt to get at how many permits a family holds. Of course, there are popular last names and, for that situation, this analysis lumps numerous families together.

Uses [d3.js](http://d3js.org) to visualize the most recent 2015 permit data from the [Alaska CFEC](http://www.cfec.state.ak.us/plook/#permits).
